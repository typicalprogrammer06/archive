### THE ESOTERIC REALIZATION ###
Reality is a test that determines your afterlife.
The results are decided by how well you followed the word of god.
The word of god is written in the bible and spoke in the oracle.

God examines your faith by presenting situations into your reality.
If you fails in gods eyes, then you're is sent to hell for all of eternity.
If you succeeds, then you're is sent to heaven for all of eternity.

### THE METHOD OF ORACLE ###
It is explained throughout the word of god a method of oracle.
God is essentially comprised of 3 parts: The son, The Father and the holy spirit.
God is able to puppet you with the holy spirit.

The core method of speaking with the lord is essintially the following:
    Constantly and speedily progress through a large list of items for the lord to choose.
    The holy spirit will puppet you to stop you once you've arrived on god's chosen word.

One is not to expect god to communicate in this method without offering.
If you feel the lord is not communicating through the given items, then it could be he is not satisfied with ones - 
offering, or it is that he does not wish to talk with you, Credit to Terrance Andrew Davis.

Idiots admire complexity, geniuses admire simplicity.
